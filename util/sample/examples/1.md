#util/sample/examples/1 Sample `Aâˆˆ(0,1)`, `Bâˆˆ(a,1)` conditioned on `B>.9`, under uniform priors `P(A)` and `P(B|a)`. Note prior for `B` is uniform only conditionally on `(a,1)` given specific `a`; its "marginal" prior `P(B)` on `(0,1)` is non-uniform.
```js:js_input

sample(() => {
  let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on (0,1)
  let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,1)
  condition(b > .9)
}, {stats:'mks tks ess wsum', plot:true, targets })

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  if (b > .9) return {a, b}
}, defined))
