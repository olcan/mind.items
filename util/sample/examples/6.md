#util/sample/examples/6 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Weight samples by _likelihood_ `P(C'∈(.495,.505)|a,b)`, equivalent to _confining a fork_ `C'|a,b` of `C|a,b` w/o sampling it. The effect on `A` and `B` is identical to confining `C∈(.495,.505)`. However the effect on `C` is _much softer_ and can be interpreted as the _prediction_ for `C` for a _future run_ having _observed_ `C∈(.495,.505)` _in a past run_. Weighting requires more information (i.e. the weight) but is more general than both confinement and conditioning and can also guide samples wherever the weights are positive (e.g. on `(.495,.505)⋂(A,B)≠∅` in this example), although not where the weights are zero, which may be a reason to prefer an equivalent confinement when one exists. Note in this example we can define _two_ equivalent confinements: the forked confinement _or its inverse_, which can only be used when the confined variable's distribution or equivalent sampler (e.g. `uniform(.495,.505)`) or domain (`between(.495,.505)`) is known.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
// confine(sample(between(a, b)), between(.495, .505)) // forked confinement
// confine(sample(uniform(.495, .505)), between(a, b)) // inverse confinement
weight(log(clip(min(.505,b) - max(.495,a)) / (b-a))) // P(C'∈(.495,.505)|a,b)

```
