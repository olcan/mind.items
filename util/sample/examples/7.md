#util/sample/examples/7 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)` conditioned on `C'==.5` using likelihood weight (density) `p(c'==.5|a,b)`. Equivalent conditioning can only be _approximated_ by confining `C'` in or around (see #//3 or #//4) a small interval `(.5-ε,.5+ε)`. Likelihoods also guide samples naturally whenever weights are positive, `.5∈(A,B)` in this example. Sampling densities `density(…)` can help compute likelihood weights when the correct distribution is known and corresponding sampler (e.g. `uniform(a,b)`) is available. If the conditioning variable is itself sampled, then density can be computed from its domain (e.g. `between(a,b)`), and this is indeed equivalent to _confining_ a fixed value to a random domain.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
// weight(log( a<.5 && b>.5 ? 1/(b-a) : 0 )) // p(c'=.5|a,b)
// weight(density(.5, uniform(a,b))) // p(c'=.5|a,b) via sampling density
// weight(density(.5, between(a,b))) // p(c'=.5|a,b) via sampling density
confine(.5, between(a,b))
```
