#util/sample/examples/6 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Weight samples by `P(C'∈(.495,.505)|a,b)`, equivalent to confining a _fork_ `C'|a,b` of `C|a,b` w/o sampling it. The effect of this weighting on `A` and `B` is identical to confining `C∈(.495,.505)`. However the effect on `C` is _much softer_ and can be interpreted as the _prediction_ for `C` for a _future run_ having _observed_ `C∈(.495,.505)` _in a past run_. Weighting is more general and powerful than both confinement and conditioning: it naturally weights samples inside domain and can also naturally guide samples outside domain whenever the weights are positive, e.g. when `(.495,.505)⋂(A,B)≠∅` in this example.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
weight(log(clip(min(.505,b) - max(.495,a)) / (b-a))) // P(C'∈(.495,.505)|a,b)

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b) // fork c'|a,b (of c|a,b)
  if (cc > .495 && cc < .505) return {a, b, c, cc}
}, defined))

const _sample_options = {
