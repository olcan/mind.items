#util/sample/examples/11 Arrays can also be sampled or confined using `sample_array` or `confine_array`. These functions are equivalent to separate calls to `sample` and `confine` for individual array elements, which can be more efficient than treating whole array as a single random variable as in `tuple`.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
// const yJ = [.4, .45, .5, .55, .6]
// const J = yJ.length
// let cJ = sample(tuple(J, between(a, b)))
// confine(cJ, tuple(J, j=>around(yJ[j], .025)))
let cJ = sample_array(5, between(a, b))
// confine_array(5, cJ, j=>around(yJ[j], .01))
confine_array(5, cJ, between(.4, .6))

```
```js:js_removed

const _sample_options = { 
  stats:'mks ess wsum r t',
  max_time:5000,
  plot:'a b',
}
