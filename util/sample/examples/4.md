#util/sample/examples/4 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Confine `C≈.5±.0001`. Confining to #///domains also enables sampler _densities_ to be used to weight samples _inside_ the domain. This ensures that the confined variable is consistent with the sampling distribution for the domain, e.g. `sample(c, around(μ,σ))`, and allows (weighted) confinement to otherwise unbounded or unconstrained domains, e.g. `around(μ,σ)` on finite numbers `(-∞,∞) ≡ {is:'finite'}`.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
confine(c, around(.5, .0001)) // ≡ condition(from(c, around(.5, .0001)))

```

  // ensures P(accept(c)) ∝ p(c) under its observed normal density
