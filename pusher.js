// TODO: implement pusher based on (simplified) #github, refactoring common code later into another item, perhaps #github.
// TODO: would be nice if pusher can handle side-push more gracefully, live-tracking changes across devices/tabs like regular pushes
// TODO: can define commands like /push, /pull, etc in this file!
