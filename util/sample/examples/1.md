#util/sample/examples/1 Sample unknowns `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`. Confine `B∈(.9,∞)` using [domain](#///domains) `above(.9)`. Confining `B∈(.9,∞)` is equivalent to conditioning on `B>.9` and can be interpreted as _observing_ `B>.9` in a random run `{A,B}` while `A` (and specific value `b>.9`) remains unknown. The effect of confining/conditioning `B` on `A` can then be interpreted as an _inference_ or _prediction_ on unknown variable `A` _having observed_ `B>.9` _(and nothing else) in the same run or in a past run_. In this interpretation the sampling distributions of `sample(domain)` act as _prior beliefs or knowledge_ (see comments below) that are updated given observations.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1)) // uniform prior
let b = sample(between(a, 1)) // uniform prior for fixed a (non-uniform overall)
// condition(b > .9)
confine(b, above(.9))

```
