#util/sample/examples/8 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)` conditioned on `C'=.5` _approximately_ by conditioning on a small interval `C'∈(.5-ε,.5+ε), ε=.0001`. This is likely to fail at initial (_prior_) sampling by failing to generate even a single sample that satisfies the condition, which provides no useful information for subsequent update steps. Instead we can use a _weight sequence_ that effectively conditions on larger intervals `ε0=0.1585, ε1=0.0631, ..., ε8=0.0001, ε9=0.0001, ...` that shrink down to the target interval in 8 updates. This typically succeeds given sufficient `max_time` and thus presents a viable alternative to likelihood weights.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on (0,1)
let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,1)
let c = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,b)
let cc = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,b)  
// condition(abs(cc-.5) < .0001)
condition(abs(cc-.5) < .0001,
  u => log(abs(cc-.5) < .0001 ** min(1,(u+2)/10)))

```
