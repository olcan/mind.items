#util/sample/examples/7 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)` conditioned on `C'=.5` using likelihood weight (density) `p(c'=.5|a,b)`. Equivalent conditioning can only be _approximated_ by confining `C'` in or around (see #//3 or #//4) a small interval `(.5-ε,.5+ε)`. Likelihoods also guide samples naturally whenever weights are positive, `.5∈(A,B)` in this example. Sampling densities (e.g. `density(.5, uniform(a,b))`) can help compute likelihood weights, but the correct sampling distribution must still be known.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
// weight(log( a<.5 && b>.5 ? 1/(b-a) : 0 )) // p(c'=.5|a,b)
weight(density(.5, uniform(a,b))) // p(c'=.5|a,b) using sampler density
```
```js:js_removed

const ts = Date.now()
const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  // we can condition in (.4999,.5001) or concentrate around .5±.0001
  // either way we have to use a fork c'|a,b since weights do not depend on c
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  // const log_p = normal(.5, .0001)._log_p
  // if (random_boolean(exp(log_p(cc)-log_p(.5)))) return {a, b, c}
  if (cc > .4999 && cc < .5001) return {a, b, c}
}, defined))
print(`sampling approximate target in/around C'∈(.4999,.5001) took ${Date.now() - ts}ms`)
