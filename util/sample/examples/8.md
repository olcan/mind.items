#util/sample/examples/8 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)` conditioned on `C'≈.5` _without computing likelihood_ `p(c'==.5|a,b)`, which is often not practical. To do this we define a custom _relaxation function_ `log_wr(r), r∈(0,1]` that guides samples toward `c'==.5` by _relaxing_ this condition based on a parameter `r∈(0,1]` adjusted automatically by the system to move samples as efficiently as possible. We consider two types of relaxation:
- _Domain relaxation_ uses a _binary_ relaxation function `log_wr(r) ∈ {0,-inf}` that indicates a _relaxed domain_ that _shrinks down to_ a target domain as `r↗︎1`. Here we use the relaxed domain `(.5-ε,.5+ε), ε=.0001**r` that shrinks down to target domain `(.4999,.5001)` for `r=1`.
- _Weight relaxation_ uses _relaxed weights_ `log_wr(r) ∈ (0,-inf)` that converge to target weights as `r↗︎1`. Here we use relaxed weights `-abs(c'-.5) * 100**r` that converge to target weights `-abs(c'-.5) * 100` for `r=1`. Weight relaxation allows much more fine-grained guidance by introducing a weight differential over the entire sample space, but the differences are smaller (and updates less aggressive) than in domain relaxation.
```js:js_input

const a = sample(between(0, 1))
const b = sample(between(a, 1))
const c = sample(between(a, b))
const cc = sample(between(a, b))
const ε = .0001
// condition(abs(cc-.5) < ε) // typically too slow
// condition(abs(cc-.5) < ε, r => log(abs(cc-.5) < ε**r))
weight(-abs(cc-.5) * 100, capture(r => -abs(cc-.5) * 100**r, {cc}))

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  if (abs(cc-.5) < .0001) return {a, b, c}
