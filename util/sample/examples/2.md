#util/sample/examples/2 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)` conditioned on _forked_ `B'>.9`. Forked vs direct conditions are equivalent for `A` but not for `B`, which is now affected only _indirectly_ through shared parameter `A`.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on (0,1)
let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,1)
let bb = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,1)
condition(bb > .9)

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const bb = random_uniform(a, 1)
  if (bb > .9) return {a, b, bb}
}, defined))

const _sample_options = { 
  targets,
  stats:'mks tks ess wsum',
  plot:true,
}
