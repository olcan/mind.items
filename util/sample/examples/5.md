#util/sample/examples/5 Sample `A∈[0,1)`, `B∈[a,1)`, `C∈[a,b)` conditioned on `C'∈[.495,.505)`. This typically requires extra time (via `max_time` option) and can still fail (and emit warnings) due to its much smaller/rarer condition.
```js:js_input

sample(() => {
  let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on [0,1]
  let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,1]
  let c = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,b]
  let cc = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,b]
  condition(from(cc, .495, .505))
}, {stats:'mks tks ess wsum t', plot:true, targets, max_time:1000 })

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  if (from(cc, .495, .505)) return {a, b, c, cc}
}, defined))
