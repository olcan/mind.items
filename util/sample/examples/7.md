#util/sample/examples/7 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)` conditioned on `C'=.5` using likelihood weight (density) `P(C'=.5|a,b)`. Equivalent conditioning can only be _approximated_ using a small interval `C'∈(.5-ε,.5+ε)` w/ cost `∝ 1/ε`, which requires extra time even at `ε=.005` as shown in example #//5. In contrast likelihood weights involve conditioning only on `.5∈(A,B)`.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on (0,1)
let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,1)
let c = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on (a,b)
weight(log( from(.5,a,b) / (b-a) ))

```
```js:js_removed

const ts = Date.now()
const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  if (from(cc, .4999, .5001)) return {a, b, c, cc}
}, defined))
print(`sampling approximate target on C'∈(.4999,.5001) took ${Date.now() - ts}ms`)

const _sample_options = {
