#util/sample/examples/3 Sample `Aâˆˆ[0,1)`, `Bâˆˆ[a,1)` conditioned _implicitly_ on forked `B'>.9` using _likelihood weights_ `P(B'>.9|a)`, effectively averaging over infinitely many forked condition indicators `(b'>.9 ? 1 : 0)`. Note the weights depend only on `A` but `B` is still affected indirectly due to its dependency on `a`.
```js:js_input

sample(() => {
  let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on [0,1]
  let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,1]
  weight(log((1-max(a,.9)) / (1-a) )) // likelihood P(B'>.9|a)
}, {stats:'tks ess elw', plot:true, targets })

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const b_forked = random_uniform(a, 1)
  if (b_forked > .9) return {a, b}
}, defined))

```
