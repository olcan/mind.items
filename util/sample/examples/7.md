#util/sample/examples/7 Sample `A∈[0,1)`, `B∈[a,1)`, `C∈[a,b)` conditioned on `C'=.5` using likelihood weight (density) `P(C'=.5|a,b)`. In this case the equivalent conditioning can only be _approximated_ using a small interval `C'∈[.5-ε,.5+ε]` and only with cost increasing as `∝ 1/ε`. Indeed this requires extra time even at `ε=.005` as shown in example #//5. Also note the weights here involve a conditioning on `.5∈[A,B)`, a much more probable event compared to `C'∈[.5-ε,.5+ε]` for small `ε`.
```js:js_input

sample(() => {
  let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on [0,1]
  let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,1]
  let c = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,b]
  weight(log( a<=.5 && .5<b ? 1/(b-a) : 0 ))
}, {stats:'tks ess elw t', plot:true, targets })

```
```js:js_removed

const ts = Date.now()
const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  if (cc > .4999 && cc < .5001) return {a, b, c, cc}
}, defined))
print(`sampling approximate target on C'∈[.4999,.5001) took ${Date.now() - ts}ms`)
