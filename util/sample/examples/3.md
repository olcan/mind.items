#util/sample/examples/3 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Confine `C∈(.4999,.5001)` using [domain](#///domains) `within(.5,.0001)`. Distances `distance(x,dom)` are used for guidance when `x∉dom`, which can be critical for _rare domains_ that are _unlikely to contain any prior samples_. Distances are not defined for all values or domains (e.g. because there may be no sensible default notion of distance), but are defined for _all domains over finite numbers_ `(-∞,∞) ≡ {is:'finite'}` as _minimum distance_ `|x-y|` over `y∈(.4999,.5001)`. Other measures of distance (or methods of guidance) can be used, see #//8.
