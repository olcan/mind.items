#util/sample/examples/4 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Confine `C≈.5±.0001` using [domain](#///domains) `around(.5, .0001)`. This domain defines non-uniform sampling densities `density(x,dom)` as weights, effectively conditioning on _relative consistency (subject to prior sampling)_ w/ a sampling distribution `x～sample(around(.5, .0001)) | x～prior` over an _unbounded domain_ `(-∞,∞) ≡ {is:'finite'}`. Densities are essential for _unbounded domains_ where (unweighted) confinement or conditioning would not make sense. Densities are defined for all domains that can be sampled as `sample(domain)`. Note in particular that unbounded domains (e.g. `above(.9)`) can not be sampled w/o additional information (see #///domains). Other measures of density (or methods of weighting) can be used, see #//8.

let a = sample(between(0, 1))

let c = sample(between(a, b))
