#util/sample/examples/2 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`. Confine `C∈(.45,.55)` using [domain](#///domains) `between(.45,.55)`, equivalent to conditioning on `C>.45 && C<.55`. Confinement (to a domain) is usually preferable to conditioning (on a boolean expression) as it enables use of _distances_ (to domain) to _guide_ samples outside the domain (see #//3) and use of _densities_ (of sampling from domain) to _weight_ samples inside the domain (see #//4). Conditioning is still useful when there is no corresponding [domain](#///domains) or when custom methods of guidance or weighting are needed (see #//8).
```js:js_input

const a = sample(between(0, 1))
const b = sample(between(a, 1))
const c = sample(between(a, b))
// condition(c > .45 && c < .55)
confine(c, between(.45, .55))

```
