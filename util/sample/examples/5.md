#util/sample/examples/5 Sample `A∈(0,1)`, `B∈(a,1)`, `C∈(a,b)`, `D∈(a,b)`. Confine `C∈(.3,.4)` or `C∈(.6,.7)` and `D<.2` or `D>.8`. Conditioning to arbitrary boolean expressions is supported, but confining to #///domains is preferable as it can handle extremely small/rare domains (e.g. `within(.5,.0001)`) or extremely large/unbounded domains (e.g. `around(0,σ)` contains all numbers) using _distances_ to guide samples outside the domain and _densities_ to weight samples inside the domain.
```js:js_input

let a = sample(between(0, 1))
let b = sample(between(a, 1))
let c = sample(between(a, b))
let d = sample(between(a, b))
// condition(c > .3 && c < .4 || c > .6 && c < .7)
confine(c, {or:[between(.3,.4), between(.6,.7)]})
// condition(d < .3 || d > .7)
confine(d, {or:[below(.3), above(.7)]})

```
