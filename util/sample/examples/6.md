#util/sample/examples/6 Sample `A∈[0,1)`, `B∈[a,1)`, `C∈[a,b)` conditioned on `C'∈(.495,.505)` using likelihood weight `P(C'∈(.495,.505)|a,b)`. Note this is equivalent to example #//5 but typically _does not_ require extra time. Also note the weights here become `0` (or `log_w=-∞`) outside of an overlap event `(.495,.505)⋂(A,B)≠∅`, which can be viewed as conditioning (before weighting) on a much more probable event compared to `C'∈(.495,.505)`.
```js:js_input

sample(() => {
  let a = sample(uniform(0, 1)) // uniform prior on [0,1]
  let b = sample(uniform(a, 1)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,1]
  let c = sample(uniform(a, b)) // uniform cond. prior on [a,b]
  weight(log( max(0, min(.505,b) - max(.495,a)) / (b-a) ))
}, {stats:'mks tks ess elw t', plot:true, targets })

```
```js:js_removed

const targets = transpose_objects(random_array(1000, () => {
  const a = random()
  const b = random_uniform(a, 1)
  const c = random_uniform(a, b)
  const cc = random_uniform(a, b)
  if (cc > .495 && cc < .505) return {a, b, c, cc}
}, defined))
